# Line_Follower_Bot
The code implements a line-following robot using 5 sensors and a PID controller. It reads sensor values to detect the line position, calculates the error, and uses proportional, derivative, and integral terms to determine the motor output. The bot follows a black line by maintaining a desired position using proportional, derivative, and integral terms.
